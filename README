> set [xaxis|yaxis|zaxis] log
> set [xaxis|yaxis|zaxis] log on
> set [xaxis|yaxis|zaxis] log off

Set log scale for particular axis if no parameter or on is given. Or turn it off
otherwise.

> set [xaxis|yaxis|zaxis] range -
> set [xaxis|yaxis|zaxis] range {real} {real}

Set axis to automatically adjust range (default) or to custom range.

> set hist scatter
> set hist scatter on
> set hist scatter off

Set scatterplot mode for histograms. Only applicable to 2D histograms.

> set hist contour
> set hist contour on
> set hist contour off
> set hist contour {integer}

Set contour plot mode for histograms. Only applicable to 2D histograms.
